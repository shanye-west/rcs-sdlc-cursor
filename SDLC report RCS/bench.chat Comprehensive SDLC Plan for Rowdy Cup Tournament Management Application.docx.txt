9. Conclusion
This comprehensive SDLC plan provides a detailed roadmap for the development, deployment, and maintenance of the Rowdy Cup tournament management application. By following this plan, the development team will be able to create a robust, user-friendly application that meets all the specified requirements while maintaining high standards of quality, security, and performance.
The mobile-first PWA built with SvelteKit and Supabase will provide tournament administrators and players with a powerful tool for managing tournaments, tracking scores in real-time, and engaging with the betting platform. The implementation of offline support will ensure the application remains functional even in areas with limited connectivity, while the Row-Level Security implementation will protect sensitive data and ensure appropriate access controls.
Regular reviews of this SDLC plan throughout the project lifecycle will help ensure that the development team stays on track and that any necessary adjustments can be made in a timely manner.
